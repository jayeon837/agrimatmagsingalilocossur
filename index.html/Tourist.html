                <h3>Magsingal Church</h3>
                <p>Magsingal, a town in Ilocandia, has a genuine church built by the Spaniards with the sweat and blood of the townspeople. The first church was a temporary building built by Padre Juan Sanches in 1723. The church was burned down during the Ilocos Revolt by Diego Silang, but the ruins still exist. The present church was constructed in 1827, and the 30 meters high church belfry was built in 1832. The church is famous for its Baroque Snomonic Altar Retable and incomparable pulpit, which attracts locals, international visitors, and high government officials. The retable features a seascape with two nude mermaids guarding St. William the Hermit, the town's patron saint. The last Spanish priest of Magsingal was Fr. Jose Vasquez, who stayed in the town from 1863 to 1898.</p>

                <h3>Magsingal Belfry</h3>
                <p>The ancient belfry of massive construction of Magsingal, Ilocos Sur was built in February 16, 1732. Magnificently over the town projects an image of antiquity of its Castillan forebears creating nostalgic feeling of the remnants of the past of more than four centuries. Behind the majestic 30-meter tall old belfry is another edifice which was once the rectory of the friar parish priest built simultaneously with the church in 1676. Owing to the strong foundation of bricks, lime, and stone wrought with hard labor by the residents of the town it had withstood disastrous calamities of fires and earthquakes. The old rectory was converted into a school building that house the special training course during the early American regime. And during the Spanish occupation, the building serves as an interment residence in Magsingal because of the murdered Japanese Captain.</p>
